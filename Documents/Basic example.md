```csharp
using QistasLinks;

Qlink link = new Qlink
{
    port = "COM5",
    rate = 115200,
    receiveMode = Qlink.ReceiveMode.UseBufferLogOnlyAvailable,
    Buffer = 30,
    linksPatterns = QLinksPattern.Create(
        QLinksPattern.Between("<", ">", (int)Msg.router),
        QLinksPattern.EndsWith("\n", (int)Msg.internte)
    ),
};

link.Init();
link.open();

Console.WriteLine(link.GetStatus());
```

In this example, we demonstrate how to use the Serial Communication Library to establish a serial connection and retrieve the status of the connection.

1. Import the `QistasLinks` namespace.
2. Create an instance of the `Qlink` class and configure its properties.
3. Initialize the serial connection with the specified parameters using the `Init()` method.
4. Open the serial connection using the `open()` method.
5. Retrieve the status of the connection using the `GetStatus()` method and print it to the console.

Please note that the code assumes that you have already referenced the necessary libraries and have the required hardware setup.

Feel free to modify the code or add further explanations as needed.

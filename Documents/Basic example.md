### Example Code Explanation

The following example demonstrates the basic usage of the QistasLinks library in C#. It showcases the creation and configuration of a Qlink object, which represents a communication link, along with initializing the connection and retrieving its status.

```csharp
using QistasLinks;

// Create a new Qlink object and configure its properties
Qlink link = new Qlink
{
    port = "COM5",
    rate = 115200,
    receiveMode = Qlink.ReceiveMode.UseBufferLogOnlyAvailable,
    Buffer = 30,
    linksPatterns = QLinksPattern.Create(
        QLinksPattern.Between("<", ">", (int)Msg.router),
        QLinksPattern.EndsWith("\n", (int)Msg.internte)
    )
};

// Initialize and open the Qlink connection
link.Init();
link.open();

// Print the current status of the Qlink object
Console.WriteLine(link.GetStatus());
The code begins by importing the necessary QistasLinks namespace to access the library's classes and functionalities.

A Qlink object is created using the Qlink class constructor. The object is then configured by setting its properties:

port: Specifies the communication port to be used, and in this example, it is set to "COM5".
rate: Sets the baud rate for the communication, which is set to 115200 bits per second.
receiveMode: Determines the receive mode for the Qlink object. Here, it is set to Qlink.ReceiveMode.UseBufferLogOnlyAvailable, indicating that received data will be stored in a buffer and logged when available.
Buffer: Specifies the size of the buffer in bytes, and in this case, it is set to 30.
The linksPatterns property is configured using the QLinksPattern.Create() method. It allows defining patterns used to parse and process incoming messages. In this example, two patterns are defined:

QLinksPattern.Between("<", ">", (int)Msg.router): Matches text between < and >, associating the matched text with the Msg.router enum value.
QLinksPattern.EndsWith("\n", (int)Msg.internte): Matches text ending with a newline character (\n), associating the matched text with the Msg.internte enum value.
After configuring the Qlink object, the Init() method is called to initialize it.

Next, the open() method is invoked to establish the connection on the specified port.

Finally, the Console.WriteLine() statement is used to print the current status of the Qlink object using the GetStatus() method. The implementation of the GetStatus() method is not shown in the provided code.

Please note that a comprehensive understanding of the code's purpose and functionality may require additional context and complete knowledge of the QistasLinks library.
